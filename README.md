# Introduction
This repository contains a modified [/IOTCONNECT Python Lite SDK](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk) application designed to receive data from **both
Python and C applications** via Unix socket or TCP which it can then transmit to /IOTCONNECT as telemetry. Additionally, the
/IOTCONNECT Relay can receive commands from the cloud and hand them off to your application(s) via Unix socket or TCP.

This framework allows users to make **minimal modifications to their existing application(s)** while still reaping the
full benefits of the /IOTCONNECT platform, and also allows multiple processes to report data to a single /IOTCONNECT
cloud connection.

The /IOTCONNECT Relay Server application is intended to be run as a service on a device and handles all cloud communication
for a user's custom application. The server listens on both a Unix domain socket and a configurable TCP port, making it
accessible to applications running in containers or on remote hosts without needing external tools like socat.

For the comprehensive guide through setting up any supported device with the Relay Service, see [GUIDE.md](GUIDE.md).

# Getting Started on Your Board with the /IOTCONNECT Python Lite SDK

Since configuring the hardware and software of your device and onboarding it into /IOTCONNECT are the first steps of the process, 
it is recommended that before jumping into the Relay Service that you first follow your board's specific Quickstart located in the 
[/IOTCONNECT Python Lite Demos](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/iotc-python-lite-sdk-demos/tree/main) repository. It will walk you through 
every cable connection, terminal command, and file needed to get your board connected to /IOTCONNECT.

This will set you up in the perfect position to easily swap out the Python Lite /IOTCONNECT QuickStart application with the 
Relay application.

[The /IOTCONNECT Relay Service guide](GUIDE.md) will refer you to your board's Quickstart for the device setup and onboarding 
process if you do not wish to do those at this time, as it is a mandatory step for all supported boards.
